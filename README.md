### AnythingGantt

It makes gantt charts out of any record in Salesforce.  You need:

* to be running Lightning Experience
* at least 2 date/datetime fields on your object (to represent the start and end)

Easiest way to get started is to create an app page in App Builder and check out all the configuration options (there's help text for each of them)

Can be used as either a standalone app page, or on the record detail page, optionally scoped to children of that record.

This is completely unsupported by Salesforce even though I work there.  Shared with the community because sharing is good.
